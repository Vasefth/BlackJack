# BlackJack
This is just a simple,java written,porgram that implements the basic functions of the card game named Blackjack.

What we basically have in this code is more like an automated play.The game starts by dealing two cards to the player and to the dealer.From the player's perspective are visible:both his cards and one of two cards that the dealer has. The player,being fully aware of his cards and their sum decides wether or not to play(by asking for another card),a decision that he has to answer in a pop up question after every deal of cards asking him hit or stay.If the player decides to hit the program continues as explained but if he decide to stay,dealer shows his cards and their sum and the program by comparing dealer's and player's sum of cards announces the winner.
